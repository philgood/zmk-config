## My layout
Here's the layout I created for a 36-key custom keyboard, with the use of Mac modifiers in mind. 

Nearly every key towards the middle of a standard keyboard are kept at their original positions. All relocated keys stay on the same hand. The layout doesn't overload any commonly used letter keys. There are only 2 additional layers and all the commonly used symbols are on the first layer.
